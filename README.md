# Memories

Memories is a sample personal blog website that emulates the functionality of a journal.

This repository holds the Backend code for the Memories website which hosts an Express server on Node.js. The server interfaces with a local MongoDB database to store entry interactions data. The server provides a RESTful API for the Frontend to interact with for entry interactions.
